`Instead, their health ministries spend much of their time worrying about illnesses caused by wealth.

`If East Asia is the centre of the epidemic, the West is not immune. Good data are harder to come by(设法得到(或获得)).

句子8：
`There are, admittedly, worse things to suffer from. But short-sightedness is not always benign. Glasses and contact lenses are an expensive, lifelong hassle. In parts of rural China, where some families cannot afford either, children struggle(挣扎) in the very(very没有任何实意，表强调) schools that are causing the problem. And severe myopia predisposes those /enduring it/ to other eye diseases in middle age, some of which can cause untreatable loss of vision. Governments in Asia are increasingly worried about the public-health implications of entire generations growing up short-sighted. Those in other parts of the world should start worrying, too.`

`is not`: 在改句子中做谓语成分，译为 `并不是`。But short-sightedness is not always benign.

难句解析:

`And severe myopia predisposes those /enduring it/ to other eye diseases in middle age, some of which (which的先行词：other eye diseases) can cause untreatable loss of vision.`

在该句中，`enduring it` 做 `those` 的后置定语，用来修饰`those`, 在这里译为：正在遭受近视的这些人们

`predispose sb to sth`: 使易于患（某种病)；容易诱发

`Stress can predispose people to heart attacks.` 紧张容易使人心脏病发作

`Governments in Asia are increasingly worried about the public-health(公众健康) implications of entire generations growing up short-sighted. Those in other parts of the world should start worrying, too.`

`generation`: （统称）一代人，同代人，同辈人，在文中使用复数形式，即表示数代人。

`growing up short-sighted`: 非谓语做后置定语，修饰 entire generations. 译为：在患有近视当中的数代人


句子9：

`The evidence suggests that regular exposure to bright daylight is vital in properly controlling the growth of children’s eyes. Too little light leads to elongated, short-sighted eyes. Researchers think that this explains why rates are so high in Asia, where a strong cultural emphasis on the value of education leads to long school days and, often, private tutoring in the afternoon and evening. That leaves little time for sunshine. Western children, whose parents are increasingly worried by a hyper-competitive jobs market that threatens much less secure employment than they enjoyed, are beginning to go the same way.`

`exposure`: n. 暴露，接触；

`vital`: adj. 至关重要的

`elongated`: adj. 细长的，拉长了的，偏长的

`hyper-competitive`: 高度竞争的

句子10：

`Special eyedrops, as well as clever glasses and contact lenses, may be able to slow the progression of myopia once it has started. But prevention is better than mitigation, and the science suggests a cheap, straightforward measure. A series of encouraging trials, many conducted in Taiwan, show that giving schoolchildren — and especially those in primary education — more time outside can cut the number who go on to develop myopia. An island-wide（全岛） policy of doing just that seems to have begun reversing the decades-long（几十年来） rise in myopia rates. Similar attempts in Singapore relied on parents, who proved more reluctant to change their behaviour, perhaps worried that other parents might not follow suit（效仿）, leaving their children at a disadvantage in the classroom.`

`eyedrops`: 眼药水；滴眼剂；眼泪

`progression`: 发展

`straightforward`: adj. 简单的，易懂的；

`trials`: n. 尝试，努力；审判；

句子11：

`Governments are well placed to solve such collective-action problems, while reassuring anxious parents that a bit less classroom time is unlikely to be catastrophic. After all, countries such as Finland and Sweden do well in global education rankings with a less intense approach to education. Giving more outdoor time to young children would still leave room for them to cram for exams in their teenage years. And longer breaks（更长的休息） in the playground may also make a dent in other rich-world problems such as childhood obesity. Far-sighted（有远见的） governments should send the kids outdoors.`


`place` v. 安排、布置

`catastrophic`: 灾难性的，毁灭性的

`reassure` v. 使安心、使放心

`collective-action`: 

`dent [ + in]`: n. 减少、耗减
